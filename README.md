GraphQL and Apollo Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of GraphQL and Apollo Server/Client to build a modern, efficient, and flexible API. The application implements key features such as querying, mutations, and subscriptions to manage and fetch data effectively.

Features
GraphQL API: A well-structured schema to query and manipulate data.
Apollo Server: Backend integration with Apollo Server for fast and scalable GraphQL APIs.
Apollo Client: Frontend integration for seamless communication with the GraphQL server.
Subscriptions: Real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions.
Data Sources: Integration with databases or external APIs.
Error Handling: Centralized and meaningful error responses.
Technologies Used
GraphQL: Query language for APIs.
Apollo Server: A fully-featured GraphQL server implementation.
Apollo Client: A state management library to interact with the GraphQL server.
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express (if applicable): Web framework for the server.
Database: Mention the database used (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
Docker (optional): For containerization.
